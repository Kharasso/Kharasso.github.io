title: "Astrodex - an Interactive Visualized Codex of Celestial Bodies"
excerpt: "<p>Collaboration with Ruijun Liu, 2020<br/>
            Built with D3.js, Aladin Lite API, and HYG 1.1 Dataset<p/>
<p>This project aims at creating a visualized CODEX for stars that are documented in the HYG Celestial Body Dataset. On one hand, it visualizes the distribution of non-spatial features of stars, which offers a way for the audience to explore stars by shared qualities. On the other hand, it also provides the user with the opportunity to explore these selected stars in space, showing them a spatial layout and also real telescopic snapshots taken from Aladin Lite API.<p/>
