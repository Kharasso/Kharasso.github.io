<p>Ukiyo-e AR is an iOS app for interactive information display in augmented reality that allows you to scan and access a collection of Ukiyo-e re-creation by contemporary artists. The displayed information is a collection of Unity game objects projected on Vuforia image targets. The 2D art pieces used in this application are credited to Japanese artist Segawa Thirty-seven, Singapore illustrator Sokkuan Tye. The 3D art used in this application is created by Minzi and Huopu.<p/>
