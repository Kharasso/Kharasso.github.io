title: "Swarmalators - Visualization and Barnes-Hut Approximation"
excerpt: "<p>Collaboration with Michael Yue and Benton Liang, 2020<br/>
            Visualization implemented with React and D3.js. <br>Barnes Hut Approximation with parallelization implemented in C++ with OpenMP and MPI<p/>
<p>This project is a study explores the visualization and parallelization of the ‘Swarmalator’ model for swarming-synchronizing system simulation as discussed in K. O’Keeffe
and C. Bettstetter (2019), ‘A review of swarmalators and their potential in bio-inspired computing’. The study includes a frontend implemented in D3.js and React for storytelling and studies on the performance of parallelized implementation of both a naive pairwise algorithm and a Barnes-Hut approximation on the model. Both algorithms are implemented in C++ and parallelized with OpenMP and MPI hybrid models. Performance evaluated on AWS MPI cluster of t2.2xlarge EC2 instances.<p/>
