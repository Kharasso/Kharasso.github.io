title: "A Python MMLA library for Kinect Analytics used for AR Collaboration Studies"
excerpt: "<p>Mentors: Prof. Bertrand Schneider and Iulian Radu, Harvard Graduate School of Education, 2019<p/>
        <p>This is part of a Python Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) library developed to capture and process learning processes in a series of experiments at the Harvard Learning Innovation and Technology Lab. My work in this library was focused on the development of a Microsoft Kinect sensor data processing functionalities for an AR-assisted learning experiment for Physics. I also implemented methods for parallelizing data cleansing, transformation, and clustering procedures to optimize efficiency, which achieved a substantial reduction in processing time, contributing to the creation of a scalable and robust library for analyzing sensor data from human subjects engaged in AR learning experiments.<p/>
