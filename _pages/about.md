Hi, I am Huopu Zhang, a master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Before joining Georgia Tech, I spent over three years as a software engineer at Morgan Stanley. My educational background includes a Master of Architecture from Harvard University and a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from Zhejiang University. I have interned as a software engineer at Dassault Syst√®mes and worked as an architect in architecture firms in Finland, Switzerland, and Arizona.

I like reading about research in NLP and ML, especially those focusing on low-resource languages and historical texts. I also enjoy reading about media studies and grapholinguistics.

<!-- I also enjoy In my free time, I enjoy browsing through equations in *Pasta By Design* (G. L. Legendre, 2011), inscriptions on various statues of Gudea, and *Metaphors We Live By* (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). -->

Research Interest
======
I have always been fascinated by signs and symbols, texts and contexts, how we perceive and process them, and how they shape our learning, communication, and decision making. Some of the research domains I am interested in include:

<!-- I like to explore how these innovations influence our perceptions, epistemological frameworks, and the formation of memories in the digital era. -->
1. Computational analyses of textual data from varied historical/cultural/social contexts. 
2. Quantitative analyses of the etics and emics of the graphical aspect of language data across diverse texts and digital artifacts found in new media and social platforms. I am also very interested in contemporary writing systems, which include modern symbols like emojis. 
3. Intelligent systems, how they process various modes of signals and establish a context of their surroundings, and how this context influences their behaviors.
4. The impact of emerging technologies, such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and the associated artifacts and materials in 3D format, on learning and acquisition processes.

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
