Work experience
======
* **Research assistant**: 
  * **New Jersey Institute of Technology, Martin Tuchman School of Management**
  * **2024.03 - 2024.08, Newark, New Jersey**
  * Supervisor: Prof. Yanguang (Alice) Liu, Prof. Dantong Yu
  * Worked under the mentorship of Professors Dantong Yu and Alice Liu on a research project for cross-sectional forecasting of hedge fund returns and fund selection. This involved analyzing features related to recent returns and market risks. I also collaborated with Professor Liu on extracting signals of abnormal returns from conference call transcripts, aiming to enhance the forecasting model by constructing additional predictive features.

* **Software Engineer**: 
  * **Morgan Stanley, Institutional Securities Technology**
  * **2021.01 - 2024.04, New York, New York**
  * Supervisor: Rati Sharma
  * In the Prime Brokerage Content space, I led the research initiative applying NLP to conduct topic and trend analysis of communication data between financial advisors and clients. This included developing models to identify key discussion themes and emerging trends to provide actionable insights.
  * I led the design and implementation of an array of dashboards for finance data visualization and monitoring. These frontends are built with React and, in cases involving legacy applications, HTML/CSS and JQuery.
  * I also led the development and enhancement of user-facing risk reviewing tools, ensuring alignment with user needs and industry standards. I managed end-to-end data pipelines, implementing seamless ETL processes for data integration using SQL, Python, and Shell scripts. I also implemented insightful data visualizations using these processed data.

* **Software Engineering Intern/Digital Teaching Fellow**: 
  * **Dassault Systèmes + Harvard Digital Giza Project**
  * **2019.06 - 2019.12, Waltham and Cambridge, Massachusetts**
  * Supervisor: Abhishek Bali (Dassault Systèmes), Prof. Peter der Manuelian (Harvard University)
  * As software engineering intern at Dassault Systèmes, I developed a museum AR prototype to add to the interactivity of exhibitions with the aim of deployment at the Harvard Semitic Museum. 
  * As a digital teaching fellow at Harvard University, I assisted Prof. Peter der Manuelian in teaching Harvard students 3D modeling of Egyptian mastabas using a cloud-based 3D modeling platform developed by Dassault Systèmes 3D Experience Lab. My role involved providing technical support, developing course materials, and facilitating discussions on topics such as the authenticity of digital reconstructions, the ethics of virtual repatriation, and curation of virtual exhibitions.

* **Research assistant**: 
  * **Harvard University, Learning, Innovation and Technology Lab**
  * **2019.08 - 2019.12, Cambridge, Massachusetts**
  * Supervisor: Prof. Bertrand Schneider, Iulian Radu
  * At Harvard Learning Innovation and Technology Lab, I worked on the development of a Microsoft Kinect sensor data processing library for an AR-assisted learning experiment for Physics. I focused on parallelizing data cleansing, transformation, and clustering procedures to optimize efficiency. Achieved a substantial reduction in processing time, contributing to the creation of a scalable and robust library for analyzing sensor data from human subjects engaged in AR learning experiments.

* **Architect**: 
  * **Localarchitecture**
  * **2018.03 - 2018.09, Lausanne, Switzerland**
  * Supervisor: Antoine Robert-Grandpierre, Laurent Saurer
