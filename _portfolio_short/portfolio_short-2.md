title: "A Visualized Spoofing Detector On a Boosted Tree Model "
excerpt: "<p>MIT Fintech Challenge Hackathon 2020, 1st Place<br/>
            Collaboration with Jerry Shu, Alikhan Nurlanuly Yerlan Sharipov, 2020<p/>
<p>This project consists of a boosted Tree model trained on a 2 million dataset to predict three types of spoofing activities in the stock market and a UI that visualizes the suspicious activities on the bid and ask timestamps. The model was trained using the Xgboost package and the imbalanced raw dataset was rebalanced using stratified bootstrapping. The
model achieved an overall f1-score of 0.82 for unseen data.<p/>
